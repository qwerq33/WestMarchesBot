# West Marches Bot

I coded this bot using Google Colab and PyCharm as my development enviroments and Python (with a couple modules including Discord.py). It rolls dice and tracks gold by Discord username and number combination. I currently have it hosted with a Google Cloud micro VM instance. 

Downsides: Since it tracks by Discord username and number, if people change their username the operator will have to retrieve their balance manually. And one hosting instance per server, to avoid overlap.
